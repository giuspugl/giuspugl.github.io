Documentation Package
---------------------

 Monte-Carlo MOlecular Line Emission MCMOLE3D is a python package which simulates the 3D  molecular cloud emission in the Milky Way. In particular, it can simulate both  the unpolarized and polarized emission coming from the   first rotational line of Carbon Monoxide (CO, :math:`J=1-0`),  which has been extensively observed during last decades. The goal of this package is to compare the simulated emission with the one observed by recent *full sky*  survey from Planck satellite. 

For a full description of the first scientific results and polarization forecasts please refer to `Puglisi et al 2017 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07856>`_ . 
 
For the Planck survey products  go to the `Planck Legacy Archive <http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#home>`_ website.
